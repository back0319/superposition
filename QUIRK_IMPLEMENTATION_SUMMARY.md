## ✅ Implemented Gates

### Basic Gates
- **H (Hadamard)** - Creates superposition, putting qubits in equal superposition
- **I (Identity)** - No-operation gate, leaves qubit state unchanged
- **X (Pauli-X)** - Quantum NOT gate, flips qubit value (180° rotation around X-axis)
- **Y (Pauli-Y)** - Pauli-Y gate (180° rotation around Y-axis)
- **Z (Pauli-Z)** - Phase flip gate (180° rotation around Z-axis)

### Phase Gates
- **T** - π/8 phase gate (eighth turn around Z-axis)
- **T† (Td)** - Conjugate transpose of T gate (-π/8 rotation around Z-axis)
- **S** - Phase gate (π/2 rotation around Z-axis, same as √Z)
- **S†** - Conjugate transpose of S gate (-π/2 rotation around Z-axis)

### Rotation Gates (with parameters)
- **Rx(θ)** - Rotation around X-axis by arbitrary angle θ
- **Ry(θ)** - Rotation around Y-axis by arbitrary angle θ
- **Rz(θ)** - Rotation around Z-axis by arbitrary angle θ

### Universal Gate
- **U(θ,φ,λ)** - Universal single-qubit rotation gate with arbitrary angles

### Square Root Gates
- **√X** - Square root of X gate (quarter turn around X-axis)
- **√Y** - Square root of Y gate (quarter turn around Y-axis)
- **√Z** - Square root of Z gate (S gate, quarter turn around Z-axis)
- **√X†** - Conjugate transpose of √X gate (negative quarter turn around X-axis)
- **√Y†** - Conjugate transpose of √Y gate (negative quarter turn around Y-axis)

### Multi-Qubit Gates
- **CNOT** - Controlled-NOT gate (flips target if control is 1)
- **CZ** - Controlled-Z gate (applies Z if control is 1)
- **CCNOT (Toffoli)** - Controlled-Controlled-NOT gate (flips target if both controls are 1)
- **CCZ** - Controlled-Controlled-Z gate (applies Z if both controls are 1)
